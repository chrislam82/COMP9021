Quiz 2 Details:
# --------------------------
Can use mark now to compare my output to expected output

Given a rule number between 0 and 15, 
rule numbers have something to do with binary representation

1st question ,just describe the rule

draw_line
4 inputs
1st is rule
2nd and 3rd is the first 2 digits
e.g. 
draw_line (10, 0, 1, 10)
01...
last digit is how many digits (so 10 bits long in the previous case)

3rd Q
Given a sequence
e.g. 
100010101010101
is there a unique rule that can produce this sequence, if not output -1, if yes, provide the rule number
Can be potentially no rule

E.g.
if in sequence I have
101
and then somewhere else
100
then obviously, this cant happen as one key cant provide 2 different rules

Dictionary then fill dictionary
if dictionary does not have enough keys
return -1
if dictionary key has 2 different values
return -1

There is a very short way to do it
u can use dir to see what fns each type has to offer

One of the fns in dict gives us a nicer way to do it (pretty sure he hinted we didnt do that one)

Check if each rule generates unique dictionary
also, is it possible to have a unique dictionary that does not match a rule from 0-15?
